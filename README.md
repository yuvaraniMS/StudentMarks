# StudentMarks
Taking marks as input for a specific student, display a table with student marks


Create a simple student marksheet system, where we are able to add student details (data
given in the above table), update/delete data. Also show a simple report like the table given
above. NO NEED for an UI. Just have the endpoints created. We could use PostMan to test
these


Use Node JS as the technology stack and Fastify as the web framework

POST /add
POST /update
DELETE/delete
GET/report
